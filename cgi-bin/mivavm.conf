# See http://www.miva.com/docs/mvadmin.html for detailed information
# on all Miva Engine configuration directives.
#
# Simple Server Safe Installation
#
# This configuration file is intended to be a starting point for
# a server safe installation.  In a server safe installation,
# the Miva binary is setuid root, and is typically installed in
# the system-wide cgi-bin directory.

# While running in server safe mode, Miva has the ability to
# process two different types of URLs.
#
# The first type of URL references a script file which is
# contained in the DocumentRoot of the WWW server.  These
# URLs take the form:
#
# 	http://www.mivasite.com/scriptfile.mv
#
# When Miva encounters a URL of this type, it looks for the
# script file in the directory defined by the mivaroot 
# configuration directive.
#
# The second type of URL references a script file which is
# stored in a user's private HTML directory.  These URLs 
# take the form:
#
#	http://www.mivasite.com/~mivauser/script.mv
#
# When Miva encounters a URL of this type, it looks for the
# script file in the directory defined by the userdir
# configuration directive.

# mivaroot defines the directory in which Miva will look for
# script files when resolving a URL that *does not* contain
# a ~user directive.
#
# Typically, mivaroot will be defined to be the same directory
# as the DocumentRoot of the WWW server.

mivaroot=/home/wclp/public_html/

# userdir defines the directory in which Miva will look for
# script files when resolving a URL that contains a ~user
# directive.
#
# The directory specified by userdir is appended to the user's
# home directory to create a full path.  For example, if 
# userdir was defined to be public_html, and user mivauser's
# home directory was /home/mivauser, then Miva would look
# for script files in the directory /home/mivauser/public_html.
#
# Typically, userdir will be defined to be the same as the
# UserDir of the WWW server.

#userdir=public_html
# Default userdir does not work with domain preview PR#24429
userdir=/home/wclp/public_html/

# authfile defines the location of the Miva Authorization File.
#
# The Miva Authorization File defines the location of Miva data
# files for a given user.  If a user does not have an entry in
# the Miva Authorization File, then that user will not be
# permitted to run Miva scripts.
#
# See the file examples/authfile for an example of a Miva
# Authorization File.

#authfile=/etc/miva.authfile

# <COMMERCE-LIB> defines the location of commerce libraries.
#
# Commerce libraries provide e-commerce functionality via
# the <MvCOMMERCE> tag.
#
# The <COMMERCE-LIB> tag requires the following attributes:
#
#	METHOD		The commerce method which the library provides.
#			This is the same value as a script must pass as the
#			METHOD attribute of the <MvCOMMERCE> tag.
#
#	LIBRARY		The full path to the commerce library.
#
# Note that the path specified by LIBRARY must be an absolute
# path (it must begin with /).
